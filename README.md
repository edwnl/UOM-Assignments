# UOM-Assignments
Stores Assignments for Melbourne Uni (Only Programming Assignments).

Note files in /misc were given as part of the assignment and were not written by me.

A brief overview of each Assignment:
## COMP10001 Assignment 1
Python Assignment involves writing functions to solve puzzles related to a whimsical story of an intrepid underground adventurer. It tests data manipulation, algorithms, and problem-solving.

## COMP10001 Assignment 2
Python Assignment involves building a simple model of a road network and simulating the behaviour of vehicles traversing the network. These tasks collectively involve constructing a road network, managing vehicle movement through intersections, considering traffic signals, and simulating the behaviour of multiple cars travelling through the network.

## COMP10002 Assignment 1
C Assignment to demonstrate understanding of arrays, strings, functions, structs and typedef facility. The program reads paragraphs of text from stdin, builds a snippet for each paragraph according to certain rules, and then writes those snippets to stdout.

## COMP10002 Assignment 2
C Assignment to demonstrate understanding of dynamic memory and linked data structures, and extend program design, testing, and debugging skills. The program is based on the problem of process discovery and requires the implementation of a simple algorithm for discovering a process model from event data.

## COMP20007 Assignemnt 1 & 2
C Assignment exploring deeper into data structures, dynamic memory, time complexity and algorithms. Consists of two parts.

## COMP20008 Assignment
Python Assignment focusing on skills in Web Crawling, Data Retrieval, Text Preprocessing, Data Manipulation and Analysis, Algorithm Design / Efficiency and Data Visualization.

## INFO20003 Assignment
SQL Assignment requires the design of efficient SQL Queries through a given database, requiring the use of Joins, Nested Queries and various SQL keywords.
